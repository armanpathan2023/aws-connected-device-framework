     * This is a stop gap in a greater refactor. Url params (e.g. offset and count) are strings.
     * Typescript does not convert them to numbers when number is declared as their type. They must be manually
     * converted whenever it is necessary that they are numbers.
     *
     * Offset and Count also both require defaults (paginated APIs should default to prevent a DOS when there's significant data).
     *
     * Finally, they both have constraints that must be checked.
     * This method combines that repetitive work into a single helper.
     *
     * TODO: remove this function. This maintains existing functionality but could be much simpler. Since offset and count
     * should always have a default and will always initially be strings, we should only replace them if they're undefined,
     * we should always convert them to numbers, and we should test that they are within the specified
     * range using ow base methods instead of owCheckOptionalNumber.
